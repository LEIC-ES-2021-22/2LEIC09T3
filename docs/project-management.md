### Retrospective

#### What did we do well?

- We managed to implement most of what we had on the iteration backlog
- We improved on what we had designed previously for the UI mockups
- Good coordination between team members and a balanced workload

#### What would we do differently?

- Better time management by distributing the implementation of features across the entire iteration
- Implement integration tests
